Miscellaneous tools
===================

Random tools/scripts I created for my own convenience. Might be useful for you too.

Each directory would contain its own README, here is an summary of each tool.

Tools can usually be built with the idiomatic build systems of their language. So:

* DLang: dub build
* C/C++: cmake -B build . && make -C build
* Rust: cargo build
